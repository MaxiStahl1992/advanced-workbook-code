    "## Example\n",
    "### Scenario\n",
    "Our goal is to use the front door criterion to measure the causal effect of motivational messages on student engagement. \n",
    "### 1. Identify the variables: \n",
    "* X (Treatment): Motivational message (0 = not sent , 1 = sent)\n",
    "* Y (Outcome): Student engagement measured on a continous scale from 0 to 1\n",
    "* M (Mediator): Study habits measured on a scale from 0 to 1.\n",
    "* U (Unmeasured Confounder): This could be the socioeconomic status, or the students mood for this example it will be introduced on a continous scale from 0 to 1. Only for data generation purposes.\n",
    "### 2. Steps:\n",
    "#### First stage (Model the effect of X on M):\n",
    "* This model estimates the impact of the treatment (sending messages) on the students study habits \n",
    "* P(M=m ∣ X=x) = β0,M +β1,M * x\n",
    "#### Second stage (Model the effect of M on Y, controlling for X):\n",
    "* This model estimates the effect of study habits on student engagement, while controlling for the direct effect of the motivational messages. \n",
    "* P(Y=y | X=x’, M=m) = β0,Y + β1,Y * x’ + β2,Y * m\n",
    "#### Calculate Marginal Probability\n",
    "*  P(X=x’) = empirical distribution\n",
    "#### Compute the expected values\n",
    "* E[Y ∣ do(X=x)] = ∑m P(M=m ∣ X=x) ∑x’ P(Y ∣ X=x’, M=m) P(X=x’)\n",
    "#### Estimate the causal effect\n",
    "* Causal Effect = E[Y | do(X=1)] – E[Y | do (X=0)]\n",
    "### 3. Adherence to Front Door Criterion\n",
    "1.\t M (Mediator) intercepts all direct paths from X (intervention or treatment) to Y (out-come):\n",
    "The primary causal pathway should be X→M→Y, with no direct edge from X to Y.\n",
    "In the example case the only direct path from X to Y through M. \n",
    "Condition is met.\n",
    "2.\t No unblocked backdoor path from X to M:\n",
    "There should not be any confounders that open a backdoor path from X to M. \n",
    "In the example case there is no backdoor path from X to M.\n",
    "Condition is met.\n",
    "3.\t All backdoor paths from M to Y are blocked by X:\n",
    "Potential confounders affecting both M and Y should be blocked by X.\n",
    "In the example the unmeasured confounder U does not directly affect M. \n",
    "Condition is met."
